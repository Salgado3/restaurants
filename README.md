**Mock-up for Restaurants**

A mock-up made using a template from https://html5up.net/ using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I created this to add to my portfolio and show potential freelance clients. It ain't much but it's honest work..

**How It's Made:**

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I started with a template from html5up and utilized the browser's inspector tool to navigate the html and css files. I updated the pictures using photos from unsplash.com. I wanted to show clients that their story and business can be displayed beautifully online with a couple of tweaks here and there.


**Lessons Learned:**

I've built website landing pages from scratch in the past. I've come to realize that templates offer the responsiveness and functionality most clients need. While buidling from the ground up is great practice to work on fundamentals, templates free up bandwidth to work on more impactful changes. Let's not build a house with our hands when we have a construction crew at our disposal.
